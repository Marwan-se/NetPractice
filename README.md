==TCP== : is a communications standard that enables application programs and computing devices to exchange messages over a network. It is designed to send packets across the internet and ensure the successful delivery of data and messages over networks

==TCP== provides several features, including:

Reliability: ==TCP== guarantees that data sent by one device will be received correctly by the other device. It achieves this through mechanisms such as acknowledgement, retransmission of lost packets, and sequencing of segments.

Flow control: ==TCP== regulates the flow of data between sender and receiver to prevent overwhelming the receiving device. It uses a sliding window mechanism to dynamically adjust the amount of data sent based on the receiver's capacity.

Congestion control: ==TCP== helps prevent network congestion by monitoring the network's condition and adjusting the transmission rate accordingly. It uses congestion control algorithms to avoid overwhelming the network with excessive traffic.

Connection-oriented: ==TCP== establishes a connection between the communicating devices before data transfer. This connection remains active until both devices agree to terminate it.
